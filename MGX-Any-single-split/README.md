# Metal Gear Autosplit
Welcome to the repository for Autosplit images when speedrunning Metal Gear (MSX).
Included are images and split files for livesplit that can offer a baseline to work with.

## Single Split
The simplest split with only one RTA split. Starts automatically and should end the timer correctly when Snake leaves the ladder into the final cutscene.

# Known Issues
The split-images were taken with PXCS2 emulation of the PS2 port of Metal Gear MSX at a lower resolution which is easier on the performance for Autosplit. When trying to use these images, it can be required to crop the game feed input for autosplit and adjust the sensitivity values accordings.

# Contribution
This repository is open for everyone to download. Contributions for more routes and alternative image-sets can be done via merge request.
